# Work not Fun Game

## Game Overview
Strategy game where you play as a manager and must balance the level of "fun" in your office to either attract more workers or make more profits. Created in 5 days for 'The Fun Button' Game Jam where the requirement was using only one button that must be labelled "Fun".

## Installation and Use
Only the Unity script files are included in this repository therefore it is not possible to install and run the entire Unity project. However a playable version is available on my [itch.io](https://fraser-curry-games.itch.io/work-does-not-equal-fun) page.
